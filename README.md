Features
Scrapes data from web pages dynamically.
Handles HTML content parsing using BeautifulSoup.
Fetches data with HTTP requests using the requests library.
Saves the scraped data in CSV format.
Includes error handling for failed requests or missing data.
Technologies Used
Python 3.x
requests - for making HTTP requests.
BeautifulSoup (from bs4) - for parsing HTML and XML documents.
pandas - for saving the data into structured formats like CSV.
Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/RachnaRamesh/Web-scraping.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd Web-scraping
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the Python script to start scraping data from the desired website:
bash
Copy code
python scrape.py
Modify target URLs or data extraction logic inside the scrape.py file according to your scraping needs.
The scraped data will be saved in a CSV file named output.csv in the project directory.
Example
Here's an example of how to scrape data using BeautifulSoup and requests:

python
Copy code
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd

# Fetch the web page content
url = 'http://example.com'
response = requests.get(url)

# Parse the content using BeautifulSoup
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

# Extract the required data
data = []
for item in soup.find_all('div', class_='example-class'):
    title = item.find('h2').text
    data.append({'Title': title})

# Save data to CSV
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df.to_csv('output.csv', index=False)
